## Introduction

Welcome to the PokéDex Website repository! This is a web application built using [Next 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and [pokenode-ts](https://github.com/Gabb-c/pokenode-ts), that provides a comprehensive collection of information about all your favorite Pokemon species.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you can simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vishal-Kamath/pokedex.git
```

After that, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd pokedex
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`. You can then open your browser and navigate to that URL to view the Pokedex website.
